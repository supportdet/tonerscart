# TonersCart — Product Requirements (Supabase edition)

## Vision
B2B marketplace for printer toners in India. Buyers search by toner model,
compare verified suppliers (city, price, Original/Compatible), and send
order requests. No payments — direct trade.

## Roles
1. **Customer** — searches catalog, places order requests, tracks orders.
2. **Supplier** — must be **admin-approved** before listing. Picks toner from
   the catalog, sets price/stock/Original-or-Compatible/image, manages orders.
3. **Admin** — approves/rejects supplier applications, sees all stats.

## Architecture (post-Supabase migration, 2026-05-03)
- **Auth:** Supabase Auth (email + password). Tokens are validated server-side
  via the Supabase Python SDK.
- **Database:** Supabase Postgres. Six tables (`users`, `toner_master`,
  `suppliers_pending`, `suppliers`, `listings`, `orders`) with RLS enabled.
- **Storage:** Supabase Storage `product-images` bucket — public read, authenticated write.
- **Backend:** FastAPI (`/app/backend/server.py`) — thin layer that uses the
  service-role client for protected ops. AI chat (Claude Sonnet 4.5) endpoint stays.
- **Frontend:** React + Tailwind, mobile-first responsive. Uses `@supabase/supabase-js`
  for auth + storage uploads, axios with Bearer token for backend calls.

## Core flows
1. **Customer signup** → `/api/auth/signup-customer` → instant login.
2. **Supplier signup** → `/api/auth/signup-supplier` (collects: business_name,
   contact_person, phone, email, city, gst_number, annual_turnover,
   business_address) → creates auth user + `suppliers_pending` row (status=pending) → user
   can sign in but `/supplier` shows "Application under review".
3. **Admin approval** → `/admin` shows pending applications → click Approve →
   row moved to `suppliers` table → supplier can now create listings.
4. **Supplier creates listing** → picks toner from catalog, enters price/stock,
   chooses **Original** or **Compatible**, optionally uploads image → image
   goes to `product-images/<user_id>/<ts>.<ext>` → public URL stored in `listings.image_url`.
5. **Buyer searches** → `/api/listings/search?q=...` returns rows with
   supplier_name, supplier_city, toner_type — UI shows colour-coded
   ORIGINAL (green) / COMPATIBLE (blue) badge.
6. **Order request** → customer sends; supplier accepts → ships (tracking) → delivers.

## What's been implemented
### 2026-05-02 — MongoDB MVP (deprecated)
Removed in favour of Supabase architecture.

### 2026-05-03 — Supabase migration ✅ (36/36 backend tests pass)
- Schema applied to project `mlvtaozdosufrhzhvgdg.supabase.co`
- 152 toner_master rows seeded (Original + Compatible only, Refilled removed)
- Admin user provisioned (admin@tonerscart.in / Admin@123)
- Replaced JWT custom auth with Supabase Auth
- New backend endpoints: signup-customer, signup-supplier, /auth/me, /listings/search,
  /listings/grouped, /listings/facets, /supplier/listings (CRUD), /orders, /orders/{id}/status,
  /admin/suppliers/pending, /admin/suppliers/{id}/approve|reject, /admin/stats, /toner-master,
  /chat
- Pending-approval gating: unapproved suppliers see a "Pending review" screen and cannot create listings (403)
- Admin Console: pending applications card list with full details + approve/reject dialog,
  approved suppliers table, stats grid
- Supplier Dashboard: stats, listings grid (with Original/Compatible badge),
  Add product dialog (toner picker → price → stock → toner type → image upload to Supabase Storage),
  recent orders pipeline (accept/reject/ship-with-tracking/deliver)
- Customer Dashboard: order summary stats + table with joined supplier info
- Search/Landing: Original/Compatible badge prominently displayed; supplier+city shown on every card
- Mobile-first responsive: hamburger drawer, bottom-sheet filters, single-column cards on phones

## Next / Backlog
- **Resend email** for supplier approval/rejection notifications + order updates (waiting on RESEND_API_KEY)
- Bulk CSV upload for supplier products
- Supplier ratings / reviews
- Order export to CSV / GST invoice helper
- Twilio OTP phone login (currently email/password only)
