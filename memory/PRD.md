# TonersCart — Product Requirements (Supabase edition)

## Vision
B2B marketplace for printer toners in India. Buyers search by toner model,
compare verified suppliers (city, price, Original/Compatible), and send
order requests. No payments — direct trade.

## Roles
1. **Customer** — searches catalog, places order requests, tracks orders.
2. **Supplier** — must be **admin-approved** before listing. Picks toner from
   the catalog, sets price/stock/Original-or-Compatible/image, manages orders.
3. **Admin** — approves/rejects supplier applications, sees all stats.

## Architecture (post-Supabase migration, 2026-05-03)
- **Auth:** Supabase Auth (email + password). Tokens are validated server-side
  via the Supabase Python SDK.
- **Database:** Supabase Postgres. Six tables (`users`, `toner_master`,
  `suppliers_pending`, `suppliers`, `listings`, `orders`) with RLS enabled.
- **Storage:** Supabase Storage `product-images` bucket — public read, authenticated write.
- **Backend:** FastAPI (`/app/backend/server.py`) — thin layer that uses the
  service-role client for protected ops. AI chat (Claude Sonnet 4.5) endpoint stays.
- **Frontend:** React + Tailwind, mobile-first responsive. Uses `@supabase/supabase-js`
  for auth + storage uploads, axios with Bearer token for backend calls.

## Core flows
1. **Customer signup** → `/api/auth/signup-customer` → instant login.
2. **Supplier signup** → `/api/auth/signup-supplier` (collects: business_name,
   contact_person, phone, email, city, gst_number, annual_turnover,
   business_address) → creates auth user + `suppliers_pending` row (status=pending) → user
   can sign in but `/supplier` shows "Application under review".
3. **Admin approval** → `/admin` shows pending applications → click Approve →
   row moved to `suppliers` table → supplier can now create listings.
4. **Supplier creates listing** → picks toner from catalog, enters price/stock,
   chooses **Original** or **Compatible**, optionally uploads image → image
   goes to `product-images/<user_id>/<ts>.<ext>` → public URL stored in `listings.image_url`.
5. **Buyer searches** → `/api/listings/search?q=...` returns rows with
   supplier_name, supplier_city, toner_type — UI shows colour-coded
   ORIGINAL (green) / COMPATIBLE (blue) badge.
6. **Order request** → customer sends; supplier accepts → ships (tracking) → delivers.

## What's been implemented
### 2026-05-02 — MongoDB MVP (deprecated)
Removed in favour of Supabase architecture.

### 2026-05-03 — Supabase migration ✅ (36/36 backend tests pass)
Replaced JWT custom auth with Supabase Auth + Postgres + Storage. See iteration_3.json.

### 2026-05-03 — v2 supplier onboarding & admin docs ✅ (46/46 tests pass)
**Schema additions** (run via SQL editor, see `supabase_schema_v2.sql`):
- `listings.toner_type` check expanded to include "Refilled"
- `suppliers_pending` + `suppliers` extended with: `pan_number`, `state`, `pincode`,
  `cities_served[]`, `seller_types[]`, `compatible_brands[]`, `years_in_business`,
  `testing_before_delivery`, plus 6 doc-path columns
  (`doc_brand_authorization`, `doc_shop_photo`, `doc_gst`, `doc_pan`, `doc_bank_proof`,
  `doc_address_proof`) and `ai_check` (jsonb)
- New private bucket `supplier-documents` with owner-folder RLS policies

**Backend additions:**
- `POST /api/auth/supplier-documents` — supplier patches doc paths after upload
- `GET /api/admin/suppliers/{id}/documents` — admin gets short-lived (5 min) signed URLs + AI check verdicts
- `email_service.py` — Resend-backed transactional emails (fires on signup → support inbox + applicant confirmation; on approve → applicant; on reject → applicant with reason). No-ops cleanly if `RESEND_API_KEY` missing.
- `ai_check.py` — Gemini 2.5 Flash vision (Emergent LLM key) verifies each uploaded document is clear/legible; result stored in `suppliers_pending.ai_check`
- `signup-supplier` handler now accepts the full extended payload and triggers email + AI check on submit
- approve/reject now copy all the new supplier fields and trigger emails

**Frontend additions:**
- `RoleChooserPopup` — first-visit blurred-backdrop popup (Buyer / Seller cards). Skipped once dismissed (localStorage flag)
- Header: removed "Admin" nav link entirely (admin reaches `/admin` only by URL)
- Glassmorphism search bar on landing hero (translucent white over dark gradient)
- Multi-step supplier registration (`Register.jsx`):
  1. **Basics** — account email/password + contact + city/state/pincode + cities served
  2. **Business** — business name, GST, PAN, turnover, years, address
  3. **Seller types** — choose up to 2 of Original / Compatible / Refilled, conditional sub-questions (compatible brands, "test before delivery" pledge)
  4. **Documents** — conditional uploads (Brand Authorization for Original, Shop photo for Refilled) + GST/PAN/Bank/Address proofs
  Files upload directly from browser to private `supplier-documents/<uid>/...` bucket using the supplier's auth session, then paths are patched server-side.
- Admin review dialog upgraded to show seller types, compatible brands, cities served, all docs as clickable signed-URL chips with AI clear/unclear/skipped badges + per-doc note
- SupplierDashboard listing form + Search filters + product card colors all support Refilled (amber)

## Next / Backlog
- **Resend email** for supplier approval/rejection notifications + order updates (waiting on RESEND_API_KEY)
- Bulk CSV upload for supplier products
- Supplier ratings / reviews
- Order export to CSV / GST invoice helper
- Twilio OTP phone login (currently email/password only)
